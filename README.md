# project-431
Project for my senior year RDBMS class. It is a command line interface which connects to a PostgreSQL database and allows for adding and retreiving different information on steam games (initially connected with a csv downloaded from kaggle) 

NOTE: may have to run database-setup.sql manually, as there were some bugs when trying ot implement it with the python code
 - YOU MUST ALSO HAVE POSTGRESQL INSTALLED ON SYSTEM TO RUN THE PROGRAM PROPERLY


if you would like a demonstration without having to setup/populate the database, you can view my demo video here: https://youtu.be/Z4rXx10gimM
